    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through the complete process of digitizing a historical map, using a map of Indonesia from our project as an example. Our goal is to digitize the road network in Indonesia to create a friction surface that represents the travel cost between any two points. With this objective in mind, we focused on finding a map where the roads are clearly distinguishable from other features. To achieve accurate digitization, we selected a map where only the roads are red, making them easy to extract.\n",

    "3 steps for digitizing: \n",
    "1. Eliminate the saturation for all colors except for red in Lightroom\n",
    "2. Use map_to_bw function below to convert the processed map from step 1 to black and white\n",
    "3. Import the black and white map from step 2 into QGIS, then convert the raster to points and connect the points using nearest points to path in QGIS\n"
